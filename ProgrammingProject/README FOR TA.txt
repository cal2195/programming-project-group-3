Hello TA!

Our progam uses Processing but we are using the NetBeans IDE to edit our code. Nicolas has permitted use to use other IDEs.
It would probably be easiest to pull our project using the NetBeans git integration and run it from there.

In addition, the project uses a database to handle the volume of information to be processed.
Please download the sample database at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw_GHviM_ci3a3NOa09zdHN0Mjg/view?usp=sharing
Put it in the root of your C: drive and run it, then pressing the Start MySQL button. This will allow our Processing application to query it.

When running our application, use the first two number keys to swap between the data for january and february,
and the gui to change views.

Thank you!
