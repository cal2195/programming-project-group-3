2. Structure
The program will contain the following components:
- Code to read in the data from a file and load it into memory.


- Code to select a subset of this data.
N.B - SUBSET - we don't have to load the whole thing. Hence, multiple loadData methods to grab the relevant data
(or store a representative sample?)
